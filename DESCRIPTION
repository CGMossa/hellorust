Description: Template R package with minimal setup to use Rust code in R without
    hacks or frameworks. Includes basic examples of importing cargo dependencies,
    spawning threads and passing numbers or strings from Rust to R. The GitHub 
    repository for this package shows how to configure CI. This package was 
    first presented at Erum2018 <https://jeroen.github.io/erum2018>; for a real
    world use case of this setup, see the 'gifski' package on CRAN.
